**In light of the removal of the malware affected mod "Increased Stack Limit", I have created a safe alternative.
In addition, I have written a section below on mod safety & security that I encourage you to read.

**BigStackz is a simple mod that allows you to customize the stack limit for all items, the default is **60**!**

To customize the stack limit, change the config value at *YourGameInstallLocation*/UserData/BigStackz.conf and restart your game.

Installation
**
1. Install[ MelonLoader](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/?id=automated-installation)ï»¿
1. Extract the zip file
1. Place the **BigStackz.dll** into the **Mods **folder (at your game install location)
1. Launch the game and enjoy!

For support, feel free to contact me on discord @SleepyStew :)
If you like this mod or appreciate my approach to keeping the community safe, I'd greatly appreciate your support through an endorsement.


**## A word on safety and security.
How I keep my mods safe:
**- I keep my nexus account secure and have 2fa enabled.
- I have my code peer reviewed to check for any potential issues.**

How you can keep your device safe:
**- Acknowledge that mods can be dangerous! Even ones that seem reputable can be destructive.
- If you aren't super technical, I recommend running any dll you may download through a service like [Virus Total](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/6150882f7d1fdc25381f26a9449b19f7f9644df4a736794535c92bc3404ec6e0) or your preferred antivirus, if it flags anything, investigate further before using it.
- If you have the means to, build the code from the source, I will have it on github soon but for now if you want the source DM @SleepyStew on discord.
- My code is never obfuscated, meaning you can download the dll and see the code for yourself using a de-compiling tool such as Jetbrain's "dotpeek". If a mod is obfuscated, I would recommend *not *using it.



## Known Incompatibilities:
